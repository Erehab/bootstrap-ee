# TASKS for Bootstrap EE

## Active Tasks

- Improve Icons page. Make mroe complete. Look at bottom of http://localhost:7788/htmltest/design-compare.html it is better. But add in more about animation. How to find icons? Show more examples. Later we will want have recommendations.
- Investigate ACP Setup section in README.md — `_bootstrap-ee.readme.md` is referenced but doesn't exist; clarify what ACP is and either create the doc or remove the section
- Start on JS Modernization Plan
- Create a documented method/process for auditing a consuming project's templates for FA 4.x icon classes and mapping them to FA 6 Pro names — needed each time BSEE is added to a project (medium).
- Consider adding an `initBootstrap(container)` helper to the bundle for initializing tooltips/popovers in dynamically injected content (easy, low priority).
