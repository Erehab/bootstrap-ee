# TASKS for Bootstrap EE

## Active Tasks

- Add in an animation library. Make sure there is good documentation.
- Start on JS Modernization Plan
- Create a documented method/process for auditing a consuming project's templates for FA 4.x icon classes and mapping them to FA 6 Pro names — needed each time BSEE is added to a project (medium).
- Consider adding an `initBootstrap(container)` helper to the bundle for initializing tooltips/popovers in dynamically injected content (easy, low priority).
