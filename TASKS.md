# TASKS for Bootstrap EE

## Active Tasks

- Implement `publish-dist` script to automate pushing built dist output to the `public` branch.
- Create a few test pages (HTML/CSS/JS) to verify the package works as expected when consumed in a real project. These are not in the public dist, just the full source for testing. No server setup, just static files with relative imports. Include some datatables and bootstrap components to verify everything works together.
- Prepare for initial release: finalize package metadata, ensure build scripts are working, and write documentation for npm package usage.
- Add TypeScript wrappers for remaining bootstrap.native components (e.g., tooltips, popovers).
- Implement legacy CSS class compatibility layer as a separate partial.
- Integrate Font Awesome Pro into the build and dist output.
